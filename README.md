Hadoop YARN & MapReduce Memory Calculator
========================

This is a simple python script that calculates the memory settings for YARN and MapReduce. It generates the values based on Hortonworks' recommendations and should serve as a good starting point for new clusters.

The script prompts for cores, ram, and disk specs of the nodes in the cluster.
